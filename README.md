# VSDotnet

VSDotnet is a project launched to use the CarSim provided by Mechanical Simulation in C#.

The main goal is to represent the results simulated in CarSim in Unity, as provided in Unreal Engine.

We started development with permission from Mechanical Simulation via Virtual Mecanical Simulation, a Japanese distributor, to develop the software based on the plugin on Unreal Engine.
Please note, however, that there is no support for both in this project itself.

We have completed the basic work on Unity and are currently developing VsConnect and other features while debugging.
